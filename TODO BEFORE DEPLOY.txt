DON'T KEEP USER PASSWORDS IN PLAINTEXT IN A PUBLICLY READABLE WRITABLE DATABASE (ok for test/toy data)

implement user accounts for my events part.

figure out how the calendar works-- good ui and whatnot

any comments labeled todo before deploy


generate unique IDs for events rather than depending on event name because many people will want to use common names e.g. "lunch", "dinner"

todo: input validation for everything

clean up all the commented out code

disable event joining once event reaches capacity unless other people join as well.

implement user accounts and related features e.g. commenting.

allow user to edit and delete events-- passwords?
